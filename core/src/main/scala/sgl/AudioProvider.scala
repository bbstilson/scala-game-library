/** Provides platform-specific Audio module.
  *
  * The Audio module defines the Sound and Music datatypes.  While both have
  * relatively similar interfaces, their usage intent, and implementation,
  * differ.  Sound are for short effect (click effect, level up, etc), while
  * Music is for long-running audio, such as background music.  More generally,
  * a Sound should generally be a small file and will be loaded in RAM
  * entirely, while Music can be much longer, will be streamed from the file,
  * and not entirely loaded in RAM. It also means that loading music can be
  * somewhat more expensive and thus it should not be used for sound effects.
  *
  * This provider is not mandatory. If your game does not require audio, you do
  * not need to mix-in an implementation for this provider. That being said, I
  * do not recommand a game without sound.

        * This method gives us a way to combine a primitive Sound into a
        * looped effect. The idea is that some sound effect can be accomplished
        * by looping a basic sound N times, and it is more efficient to just
        * store one iteration of the loop (both in resources and then loaded in
        * memory) but then to use some looped behaviour logic when playing.
        *
        * You can also control the playback rate of the sound. The rate is
        * essentially how quickly we play the sound. If rate is 2f, then we
        * play the sound twice as fast, and if it is 0.5, we play it at half
        * speed. Valid values are from 0.5f to 2f. Controlling the rate is
        * fundamentally a very simple signal processing, where the samples are
        * interpolated/removed to match the rate. For example, with a rate of
        * 2, all that happens is that 1 in every 2 sample is removed, which
        * means that the final sound is only half the length. For a 0.5 rate,
        * we interpolate new samples to make the sound longer (frame 0 is
        * there, frame 1 is interpolated from frame 0 and 1, frame 2 is there
        * again, etc). This also supports more general values such as 1.75f, in
        * this case the interpolation generalizes to fractional frames.
        *
        * After calling withConfig, you end up with two independent Sound
        * instances in your system, and you must dispose both, or you can
        * dispose one of them and keep using the other one. Typically, you
        * might want to load the sound sample, call withConfig to get the play
        * configuration, and then dispose the original as you are only planning
        * to use the custom version from now on. Although it looks like we end
        * up with using double the resources with both Sound object, it's
        * likely that the underlying backend actually optimizes memory to only
        * load the primitve sound once, and just keep track of the settings and
        * disposed state.
        *
        * @param loop the number of times the sound should be looped (-1 for
        *   infinity, 0 for regular play, any other positive numbers for number
        *   of repeats)

        * around the Sound class (by playing 3 times in a row). But first that
        * would require to detect when the sound effect is completed, and then
        * it's also additional logic that needs to run, while most backends
        * actually support natively the concept of looping a sound, so it
        * probably makes sense to offer this feature in the Sound API directly.
        *
        * Note that the API only allows to clone a Sound to get a looped
        * version instead of actually setting the looped state. It is a
        * deliberate design, as usually immutability is better, and in the case
        * of sound effects, it's very likely that you want to build the proper
        * sound configuration from the sound file and then just play it as is,
        * instead of changing the state in each frame. This also give you the
        * ability to use the same sound file, load it only once, and combine it
        * in several different sound instances (you couldn't do that if you had
